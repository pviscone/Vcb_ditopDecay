# Reconstruct the $t\bar{t}$ kinematics

> 1. Reconstruct the variables:

>    - [x] $M\_t$
>    
>    - [x] $M\_{\bar{t}}$
>    
>    - [x] $M\_{W^+}$
>    
>    - [x] $M\_{W^-}$
>    
>    - [x]  Divide all in leptonic and hadronic decays
>    
>    - [ ] fit a Breit-Wigner for each histogram (this is important to understand the magnitude of the non resonant decay)
> 
> 2. - [x] Do the same plots for $\eta$ and $p_T$
> 3. - [x] Create and histogram containing all the  possible $q\bar{q}$ couples and fill it with the hadronic W decays

# LHEPart_pdgId structure

There are 9 particles (the 6th(5) and the 7th(6) are produced by the same W. The same stans for the 8th(7) and 9th(8) ):

* The first 2 (0,1)particles of each events are the incoming particles (gluons)

* The 3rd (2) particle is the additional parton (NLO montecarlo)

* The 4th and the 5th (3,4)are the $q_-$ and $\bar{q}^{'}_+$ produced by  $t\bar{t}$

* Be aware!! The 6th (5) particle could be produced both from the $t$ or the $\bar{t}$. Look at the electric charges
  
  - IF the 6th particle has charge < 0, it comes from a $W^-$
  
  - IF the 6th particle has charge  >0, it comes from a $W^+$

The quark in $t \to q W^\pm$ has the opposite charge of the $W^\pm$ and $t$ has the same charge of the $W$ ( so $t \to q_{-}W^+$  or $\bar{t} \to \bar{q}_{+}W^-$ )

### Observation and doubts

- Event 1008: there is a $c$ in the position 0. So, a $c$ is an incoming particle  
  
  - Why a c quark is an incoming particle??

- **The Ws decay only in ud,us,cd,cs pais. The motecarlo was generated with some strange cuts???** 

### Questions

- Ci sono modi pi√π veloci di usare root o va bene usare il plain C in questo modo?
- Esistono degli header preimpostati per importare lo stile dei plot CMS
