# Reconstruct the $t\bar{t}$ kinematics

> 
> 1. - [ ] **Set the CMS Plot Style** (Partially done (?))

> 2. Reconstruct the variables:

> # Fix
> 
> - [x] For the M plots, create another version with a wider scale on the x axis
> 
> - [x] Fix the ratio w jet decay (and rename it in W hadronic decay)
> 
> - [x] Make 2 kind of plots: one divinding for the particle charge (e.g. W+,W-), one dividing for the production (hadronic, leptonic)
> 
> # Questions
> 
> - Why the gluon fusion production (90%) dominate over the quark production (10%)?
>   
>   - At the LHC energy the bjorken variable $x=\frac{|q|^2}{2p_{in}^{\mu} q_{\mu} } $ is small and for small X the gluon PDF is much higher than the quark PDF.
>     
>     For example, at the Tevatron, the CM energy was 1TeV  and ttbar production was mainly from valence quarks

# LHEPart_pdgId structure

There are 9 particles (the 6th(5) and the 7th(6) are produced by the same W. The same stans for the 8th(7) and 9th(8) ):

* The first 2 (0,1)particles of each events are the incoming particles (gluons)

* The 3rd (2) particle is the additional parton (NLO montecarlo)

* The 4th and the 5th (3,4)are the $q_-$ and $\bar{q}^{'}_+$ produced by  $t\bar{t}$

* Be aware!! The 6th (5) particle could be produced both from the $t$ or the $\bar{t}$. Look at the electric charges
  
  - IF the 6th particle has charge < 0, it comes from a $W^-$
  
  - IF the 6th particle has charge  >0, it comes from a $W^+$

The quark in $t \to q W^\pm$ has the opposite charge of the $W^\pm$ and $t$ has the same charge of the $W$ ( so $t \to q_{-}W^+$  or $\bar{t} \to \bar{q}_{+}W^-$ )

### Observation and doubts

- **The Ws decay only in ud,us,cd,cs pais. The motecarlo was generated with some strange cuts???** :
  
  Probably only the Cabibbo mixing is enabled.
  
  In TT_hdamp_NNPDF31_NNLO_ljets/poweg.input there is:
  
  ```fortran
  topdecaymode 11111   ! an integer of 5 digits that are either 0, or 2, representing in 
                       ! the order the maximum number of the following particles(antiparticles)
                       ! in the final state: e  mu tau up charm
                       ! For example
                       ! 22222    All decays (up to 2 units of everything)
                       ! 20000    both top go into b l nu (with the appropriate signs)
                       ! 10011    one top goes into electron (or positron), the other into (any) hadrons,
                       !          or one top goes into charm, the other into up
                       ! 00022    Fully hadronic
                       ! 00002    Fully hadronic with two charms
                       ! 00011    Fully hadronic with a single charm
                       ! 00012    Fully hadronic with at least one charm
  
  semileptonic 1      ! uncomment if you want to filter out only semileptonic events. For example,
                       ! with topdecaymode 10011 and semileptonic 1 you get only events with one top going
                       ! to an electron or positron, and the other into any hadron.

### Technical doubts

- Ci sono modi pi√π veloci di usare root o va bene usare il plain C in questo modo? Conviene imparare a usare rdataframe per sfruttare multithreading implicito?
- 
- Come posso fare uno scan filtrando per istanza?
  - Semplicemente usa le parentesi quadre [idx]
