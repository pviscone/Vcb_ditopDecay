## Neutrino reconstrucion

Considering the lepton massless

$$
p_W^2=(p_l+p_\nu)^2 \\
\\ \;
\\ \;
\implies 4p_{l,t} p_{\nu,z}^2-4p_{l,z}(M_W^2+2 \vec{p_{l,t}} \cdot \vec{p_{\nu,t}})p_{\nu,z}-\\
\\
-(M_W^2+2 \vec{p_{l,t}} \cdot \vec{p_{\nu,t}})^2+4E_l^2p_{\nu,t}^2=0
$$

Solve for $p_{\nu,z}$

If $\Delta>0$ choose the smallest solution

If $\Delta<0$ impose it to 0 (take only the real part of the solution)

This approach is not based on physical reasons.

There are other approachs (also using flows and NN) but here was used the simplest method

## Observation

- There is a strange modulation in MET_phi (It should be uniform)
